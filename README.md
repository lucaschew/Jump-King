#Jump King

This project was a unity game created in 2019 for trying to replicate Jump King, which is a jumping puzzle game for Windows.
The goal was to try to create something similar for mobile, as there was not a port at the time.

The game only has 2 levels and has been stopped, though I will link an apk download for testing/inspiration purposes.
